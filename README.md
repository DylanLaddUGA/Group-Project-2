# Dataset Description
The dataset we used for this project was
(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). This dataset contained 24 columns and over 5.72 million rows of data regarding arrest details, demographic information such as age, race and gender, the type of offense that was committed and where the offense took place. Listed below is each of the columns and what each column represents. The dataset originally had data from 2006; however, we decided to use data from more recently (1/1/2020 - 12/31/2023) to address if COVID had any impact on more recent crime. After manipulating the dataset to just contain the set dates we wanted the rows decreased from 5.72 million rows to just about 700,000. 

# Question 1 Explained
What trends emerge when analyzing the relationship between age and demographics and the prevalence of specific types of crime in New York City?

Importance:
This question would help with understanding which age groups are more susceptible to certain types of crimes, in turn this could help to inform law enforcement strategies and crime prevention efforts. By identifying the trends in crime prevalence it would allow for authorities to allocate resources to be more efficient in reducing crime. Examining the relationship between age and demographics would bring forward certain societal issues such as inequality, poverty and gaining access to important education and employment opportunities, identifying the societal issues and allocating the needed resources to stopping crime would lead to a decrease in long term crime rate. Finally by grasping the trends and enforcing the preventative measures it would allow for New York City to become safer as a whole.


# Question 2 Explained
Does the borough and covid have an impact on the number and type of crime that takes place?

Importance:
This question is important because New York City has a large population, so it is necessary to break it down into smaller chunks such as boroughs. Each borough is distinct in terms of features such as the culture, attractions, and the people who live there, so it is important to individualize them versus grouping them as one. Because of these differences, the amount of crimes and type of crimes will differ vastly among the boroughs. Some places may have more serious crimes, where other boroughs may have a greater amount. Itâ€™s important to highlight the differences, as it allows for police forces to allocate their limited number of resources in a vast population to the places that need it the most. Examining trends and relationships will allow for an eventual decrease in crimes that will take place within each borough, overall decreasing the crime rate for New York City. It is also important to examine the differences between now and when the covid pandemic started. We want to see the differences in crime rate, with factors such as unemployment and lifestyle changes potentially increasing or decreasing the crime rate and types of crimes occurring. Understanding if these factors are important in terms of crime can signify whether the New York government should take action in regard to these issues for tackling the issue of crime.
